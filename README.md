# Project
Please look through my project the war file is failing to run 

I get error  Caused by: org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanCreationException: Could not autowire field: private Products.Product.Service.ProductService Products.BoutiqueManagmentSystem.ProductController.productservice; nested exception is org.springframework.beans.factory.NoSuchBeanDefinitionException: No qualifying bean of type [Products.Product.Service.ProductService] found for dependency: expected at least 1 bean which qualifies as autowire candidate for this dependency. Dependency annotations: {@org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired(required=true)}

      I have sofar created the save method buts for now the war file does not start up.
